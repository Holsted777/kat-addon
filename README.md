KAT / kickass torrents add-on for stremio
==============================

This would allow you to watch/stream movies or tv shows from kickass torrents.

IT's entirely automatic, it has no hardcoded movies/series.

It's comparable to the Juan Carlos Torrents or Popcorn Time add-ons, but it may work better in the future. Please test it and feedback if this works better for you and what issues it has

To run, do:
```bash
git clone http://github.com/JCB9090/kat-addon
cd kat-addon
npm install
node index
```

You have to have node.js and npm installed 

Then, run Stremio with:
```
%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\LNV\Stremio\Stremio.exe launch --services=http://localhost:7321/stremioget
```


Happy watching!
